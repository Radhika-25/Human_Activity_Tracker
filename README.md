The 4 main principles of OOP's are:
  1.Encapsulation: Combining objects and methods into a single unit inorder to hide the data from external users.
  2. Abstraction: Hiding of internal data and implementation details of the component from other application components and displaying the                     information which is necessary only.
  3.Inheritance: There can exist a heirarchial relation between 2 objects or classes. Its used for code reusability.
  4.Polymorphism: Using diffrent classes which are connected by the same parent class.
